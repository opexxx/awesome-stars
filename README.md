- [jcgarciagamero/No-More-passwd](https://github.com/jcgarciagamero/No-More-passwd) - Sistema de login con Telegram, mediante contraseñas temporales, que se borran tras iniciar sesión. El nombre de usuario está hasheado para que no se pueda identificar, con lo que el único dato del usuario sería su ID del bot de Telegram.  La idea era utilizar el segundo factor como primero y que los usuarios no tengan que estar pensando una contraseña diferente para cada servicio. Si hubiese una brecha de seguridad, el problema de la contraseña desaparece. La única manera posible que se me ocurre de robar la cuenta, sería que tuviesen acceso al servidor, supiesen que el hash del usuario corresponde a un usuario determinado, o supiesen el chat ID para introducir una contraseña temporal, ya que si el campo está vacío no puede acceder. Además de todo eso, el usuario debería aceptar el inicio de sesión, con lo que, a no ser que pase algo por encima, sería muy complicado sin acceso físico a su cuenta de Telegram.

Therefore, it is usually the primary target for most of the malicious attacks such as DNS Poisoning and Rogue DNS servers. With the help of 0x20 bit encoding, the problem of DNS Poisoning is mitigated to quite a large extent. Although, it has a minor requirement that the authoritative nameserver should be able to preserve the case of the DNS query. It is usually difficult to detect the rogue DNS server above the stub resolver. We propose an anomaly detection system which would be able to raise a red flag in case of DNS Poisoning and malicious DNS authority by passive DNS analysis of domain names and then comparing them with the 0th day cluster of the database. We perform the passive DNS analysis for 27 days by querying the whois server of CYMRU, compare the network profiles of the domain names crawled with the 0th day cluster and categorize the domain names as static, benign anomaly and malicious anomaly depending upon the cluster a domain name shifted. In the process, we also create a WHOIS repository for Alexa domain names which is faster to query than the WHOIS server.
